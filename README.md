# Setup

All steps assume the current directory is the repo's top-level dir (where this file is).
It is assumed that the machine name is in `$MY_MACHINE`.
This all should just be a script...

## Sway

- `ln -s $PWD/config/sway/config ~/.config/sway/config`
- `ln -s $PWD/config/sway/$MY_MACHINE ~/.config/sway/local`
- `ln -s $PWD/config/i3status/config ~/.config/i3status/config`
